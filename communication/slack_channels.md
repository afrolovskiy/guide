# Slack Channels

Please find a list here of Slack channels at source{d}.

Slack channels are encouraged to be open for everyone to join. Private channels for professional reasons are highly discouraged (have fun with private personal slack channels).

### General channels

* `#general`
* `#offtopic`
* `#officechat`
  * Physical office related discussions
* `#offtopic-`
  * Search in slack for `#offtopic-` and you'll find different offtopic channels like `#offtopic-music`
* `#osd`
  * `#osd` stands for Open Source Days, people share what they'll be working on during their OSD and share the results/demos
