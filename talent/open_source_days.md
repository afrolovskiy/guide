# Open Source Days

Developers at source{d} dedicate 10% of their development time to open source projects of their choice.
This is accomplished with Open Source Days (OSD), which happen on the first Monday of each sprint.

## The Rules

### Open Source Everything

The result of OSD MUST be open source, whether it is code, prose, a dataset or a [beer recipe](https://github.com/src-d/homebrew). We generally use public GitHub repositories for this. They can be either in a personal account, a dedicated organization or the [src-d organization](https://github.com/src-d).

### DON'T do your job

OK. Actually, OSD is part of every source{d} developer's job. But the decision on what to do
on OSD should be driven exclusively by your interests. While you can work on a source{d} project such as
[go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git), we also encourage you to work on something not related
to your daily job.

### Demo

Whatever you do, you must demo it to your colleages. We prefer actual demos, not slides or code
walkthroughs.

## How To

1. **Prepare.** Get to the office before 10:30 a.m. and prepare your work for the day.
2. **Share your plan.** At 10:30 we do the OSD planning meeting. You should briefly explain what you are going to do and what do you expect to accomplish by the end of the day. This should be just 1 or 2 minutes per person. Explanations about the project you're going to contribute are done in the `#osd` slack channel.
3. **Do it.** Execute your plan for the day and push it!
4. **Demo.** At a time agreed by the team, usually at 17:30, the demo starts. Everyone presents their work to others in 5-15 minutes.
