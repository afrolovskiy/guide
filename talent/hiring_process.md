# Hiring Process Explained

This document explains the internal hiring process at source{d} and the responsibilities for each person related to it.


### Job Description

- Job Description is written by the lead engineers with the Talent's Manager support. 

- For every meeting between the lead and Anna there will be a PR in the [minutes](https://github.com/src-d/minutes) repo and the job descriptions will be uploaded at the private repository https://github.com/src-d/company.

- CTO and CEO should be added as reviewers (but should not be bottlenecks to continue).

- Anna posts the job description through Lever on the source{d} website.

### Sourcing

- Lead engineers are responsible to identity people to be contacted and other sourcing channels such as niche job boards. 

- At any given moment the Talent Manager is able to drop in and work on finding more developers.

- Developer lists/sourcing channels should continuously be defined and refreshed after communication between the Talent Manager and the leads. 

- The Talent Manager is responsible to work with the Developer Community team in order to gain people through community actions (Twitter/Blog etc.). 

### First Contact

- Any developer should be contacted by the lead engineers or under their name at least (after together defining the outgoing message). In case the Talent Manager is contacting them, it should be done from the lead's email acccount. It's a motivating factor for the developers to be contacted by the lead engineers. 

### Screening

- If the developer is an applicant, they should be accepted/rejected by the lead engineers during the screening phase. 

- If the developer is approached by us from a specific source (known from meetups, having worked together in the past,  etc.), they should move forward to the next step as it means that the leads have already shown interest.

### First Skype/Zoom/Phone Interview

- A quick Skype/Phone/Zoom call should be available to every developer who is interested in the roles*. It is a general discussion to know more about the background and experience of the candidate. And to share as much as possible from our side about the team & company. 

\* There a noteable exceptions to this, such as higher volume junior roles where we directly ask the developer to do the coding challenge before a call. 

- Lead engineers are responsible to make the calls as it's a motivating factor for the developers. Leads will also be able to assess early in the process if the interview process should continue or not. 

### Coding Challenges 

- Every candidate who passes the first Skype interview, should complete the coding challege. 

- In case of the Machine Learning team, there is an additional ML task necessary to be solved.

- Coding Challeges are being sent to the candidates by Anna and the results are being reviewed by the lead engineers. 

### On-site Interview
 
- This is the last step in which it's  decided if the candidate will receive an offer or not. It might last a full day or be split across two half-days, depending on the availability of the candidate. 

- The interviews are the followings: 

* Kickoff with Maximo, QA: to know the candidate better
* Design interview: to see how the candidate would design a solution to a given technical problem working with a several of our engineers
* Logical thinking: to see how the candidate solves an abstract problem in a logical way.

- In case of rejection, the candidate should be notified in person on the day by the lead of the corresponding team on why he was rejected. This should be a constructive discussion giving the candidate as much insights as possible.

### Offer

- The offer is being sent by the CTO on Lever. 

- The candidate has no time deadline to accept/reject the offer. Only in cases that we have more candidates in the offer state for one opening where decisions need to be made. 

## Notes 

### Exceptions 

- There are exceptions to the above steps for internship roles. The first step in this case is the Coding Challenges and then a technical Skype interview. 
 
 ### Feedback

 - After the coding challenge it's very important to gain feedback of the CTO at each next step.
