### Job Description

### Sourcing

- In case there is lack of candidates, Anna is responsible to contact Francesc in order to gain people through community actions. 

### First Contact

- Any developer should be contacted by the lead engineers or under their name at least. In case Anna is contacting them, she should use their email address. It's a motivating factor for the candidates to be contacted by the lead engineers. 

### Screening

- If the candidate is an applicant, they should be accepted/rejected by the lead engineers during the screening phase. 

- If the candidate is approached by us from a specific source (known from meetups, having worked together in the past,  etc.), they should move forward to the next step as it means that the leads had already shown interest. 

### First Skype Interview

- A quick Skype call should be made with every candidate who is interested in the roles. It is a general duscussion to know more about the background and experience of the candidate. 

- Lead engineers are responsible to make the calls as it's a motivating factor for the candidates and also the leads will know from early on if they would like to work with them or not. 

### Coding Challenges 

- Every candidate who is passing the first Skype interview, should complete the coding challege. 

- In case of Data Science, there is an additional ML task necessary to be solved.

- Coding Challeges are being sent to the candidates by Anna and the results are being reviewed by the lead engineers. 

### On-site Interview

- This is the last step in which it's being decided if the candidate will receive an offer or not. It might last a full day or being split in two days, regarding the availability of the candidate. 

- In case of rejection, they candidate should be notified by the lead of the corresponding team. 

### Offer

- The offer is being sent by Maximo on Lever. 

- The candidate has no time deadline to accept/reject the offer. Only in cases that we have more candidates in the offer state for one opening where decisions need to be made. 

## Notes 

### Exceptions
